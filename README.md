# Supply-Chain & Geoeconomic Threat Assessment Lab

This repository contains materials for a supply‑chain and geoeconomic threat assessment lab. It guides you through assessing geopolitical and economic risks within supply chains by fusing multiple public data sources such as corporate registries, shipping manifests, sanctions lists, trade data and economic indicators. The lab emphasises OSINT tradecraft—intelligence is produced by collecting and analysing only publicly available information.

## Overview

In this lab you will:

- **Define the scope:** Choose a sector, company or region to analyse and describe the critical products, services or components involved.
- **Plan OSINT collection:** Identify and gather data from corporate ownership filings, maritime/shipping databases, sanctions lists, court documents, news and economic datasets.
- **Ingest and normalise data:** Use Python or a notebook to compile and clean the data, mapping suppliers, customers, geographic locations and ownership links.
- **Assess vulnerability:** Build a weighted matrix to evaluate factors such as supplier concentration, geopolitical risk, regulatory exposure and financial ties. Highlight key nodes and potential single points of failure.
- **Analyse and brief:** Write an analytic note summarising the findings, including confidence levels and assumptions. Provide recommendations for diversification or mitigation.

All data used in this lab comes from public sources. By applying structured OSINT fusion, you can reveal hidden dependencies and geoeconomic risks in supply chains without access to proprietary information.
